# Question 2 - Calculating a moving average using Python
<br />
You are given a list of numbers J and a single number p.<br />
Write a function to return the minimum and maximum averages of the sequences of p numbers in J. <br />
Example:<br />
<br />
J = [4, 4, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12]<br />
p = 3<br />
<br />
The sequences will be:<br />
<br />
(4,4,4)<br />
(4,4,9)<br />
(4,9,10)<br />
(9,10,11)<br />
(10,11,12)<br />
<br />
Here the minimum average will be 4 and the maximum average will be 11, which corresponds to the first and last sequences. <br />
